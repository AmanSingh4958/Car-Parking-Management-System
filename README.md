# Car-Parking-Management-System
This Project is created using C++ language <br />
Copy the content of the cpp file and run it in your IDE ( This code runs fine in my system so there should not be any problem encountered, if in any case an error is encountered please fix it ) <br />
VSCode is recommended to run this code because there can be some header files which your system may not have. <br />
This project uses file handling to store all the user entered data into the two database files <br />
Database files : <br />
    --> carparkdb.txt : This file stores all the information of the car and other data entered by the user. <br />
    --> carparkexpensedb.txt : This file contains the expenses accumulated for the car in the time being. <br />
Don't change the data inside of the database file if it is not understandable by you. <br />
